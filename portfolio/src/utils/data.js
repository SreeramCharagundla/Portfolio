    role: "Software Engineer",
    detail:
      "During my tenure at Infosys Limited, I gained extensive expertise in backend and full-stack development through two significant projects. As a Full Stack Engineer, I worked on Wanderlust, a responsive travel booking platform leveraging the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and TypeScript. I implemented scalable front-end solutions, optimized performance using techniques like Lazy Loading and Angular Pipes, and ensured seamless communication mechanisms. Using Dynatrace for log monitoring, I minimized production issues, driving exponential growth in bookings. Later, as a Software Engineer for the Government of Indiaâ€™s Income Tax Portal, I specialized in backend development with Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and RESTful APIs. I engineered a pre-fill module to streamline data processing for over 950M taxpayers and designed scalable Spring Batch Applications. By utilizing Kafka-based messaging systems, JSON for data exchange, and core Java concepts like multithreading, I built high-performance, real-time systems. Employing test-driven development (TDD), Git, CI/CD pipelines, and SonarQube, I ensured code quality and scalability. These experiences solidified my skills in real-time data processing, backend development, and delivering robust, scalable applications.",
